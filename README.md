Unity Dual Grid System
A little Tech Demo
Note:
It does NOT use RuleTiles directly, but does act similarly to them. It uses a custom script with hard-coded "rules" to control the placement of regular tiles.

Compared to a normal RuleTiles:
-a maximum of only 16 tiles are required in the tileset, as opposed to 47
-rounded corners and not ambiguous align with the world grid

It is possible to get a dual-grid system working using custom RuleTiles too, however it did become quite convoluted when I tried
